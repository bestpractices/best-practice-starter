# Choosing npm package dependency thoughtfully

✅ The decision must follow a comparison table of options using [this template](https://github.com/practicajs/practica/blob/main/docs/docs/decisions/configurationLibrary.md)

✅ Usage state must be captured including weekly downloads, GitHub stars and dependents. Only top 5 most popular vendors can be evaluated

✅ The evaluated libs must have been updated at least once in the last 6 months
