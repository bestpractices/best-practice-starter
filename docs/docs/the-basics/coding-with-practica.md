# Coding with Practica

Now that you have Practice installed (if not, do this first), it's time to code great code using it

## Pre-requisites

Just before you start coding, ensure you have Docker and nvm (a utility that installs Node.js) installed. Both are considered as a good practice for development

## What did you install?

You now have a folder with Practica inside. What exactly can you find in this folder? An example Node.js solution with a single component (API, Microservice) that is called 'order-service'. Of course you'll change its name to something that represents your solution

Besides this component, there are also a bunch of reusable libraries like logger, error-handler and more. All sit together under a single root folder in a single Git repository - this style is called a 'Monorepo'

The code inside is coded with TypeScript and embodies many great practices that we thoughtfully picked

## Running and testing the solution

A minute before we start coding, let's ensure the solution starts and the tests pass. This will give us confidence to add more and more code knowing that the tests are watching our back

Just run the following typical commands:

1. CD into the solution folder

```bash
cd {your-solution-folder}
```

2. Install the right Node.js version

```bash
nvm use
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the tests

```bash
npm test
```

Tests pass? Great! ü•≥  

They fail? oppss. Approach our discord or open an issue please

5. Optional: Start and check with Postman

Some rely on testing only, others like also to invoke routes using POSTMAN and test manually

```bash
npm start
```

Now visit our online POSTMAN collection, explore the routes, invoke and make yourself familiar with the app

We have the ground ready üê•. Let's code now, just remember to run the tests once in a while to ensure nothing breaks

## The layers of a component in less than 2 minutes

A typical component (e.g., Microservice) contains 3 main layers. Each layer owns a plain folder.

**- Entry points -** This is the door to the application where flows start and requests come-in. Our example component has a REST API (i.e., API controllers), this is one kind of an entry-point. There might be other entry-points like a scheduled job, message queue and more. Whatever entry-point you're dealing with, the responsibility of this layer is minimal - receive requests and adapt them to the internal language. For example, a controller gets API request and does nothing than extract then authenticate the users, extract the payload and call a domain layer function üëá
- Domain - 
- Data-access - 

## Let's code a flow from API to DB and in return


- Coding common things
  
  * Change the service name
  * Modify fields
  * Add business logic
  * Add !Microservice

- Various commands
  
  * Migration

- Ideas: Running the code, plain JS, no abstractions, - Focus or not
