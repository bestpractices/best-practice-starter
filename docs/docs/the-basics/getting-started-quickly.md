# Getting started quickly


To run Practica in Interactive Mode (with UI):

```bash
npx @practica/create-node-app interactive
```

Or if you'd prefer a typical terminal experience (without UI):

```bash
npx @practica/create-node-app immediate
```

âœ¨ And you're done! That's it. The code's all been generated.
