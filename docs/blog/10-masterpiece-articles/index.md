## What's so special about these articles?

Intro

I read 100+ articles, scanned Google, mostly JS, 

### 🏅 1. 'Unit test fetish'

**✍️ Author:** Martin Sústrik

**🔖 Abstract:** The article opens with 'I hear that prople feel an uncontrollable urge to write unit tests nowaydays.

The article illustrate this with a frontend code example but the lesson takeaway is ubiquitous to any kind of testing
